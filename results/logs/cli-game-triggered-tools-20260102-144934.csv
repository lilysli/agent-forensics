Run the game: `python blueberry_game.py`\n2. Use the WASD keys to move your player (P):\n   - W: Move Up\n   - S: Move Down\n   - A: Move Left\n   - D: Move Right\n3. Collect blueberries (B) to score points (+10 per blueberry)\n4. Avoid obstacles (X) - hitting one ends the game!\n5. Press Q to quit at any time\n\n## Features\n\n- Randomly generated levels with blueberries and obstacles\n- Score tracking\n- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty\n- Simple ASCII graphics\n- Terminal-based gameplay\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.x\n- No external dependencies required\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game: `python blueberry_game.py`\n\n## Controls\n\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| W   | Move Up |\n| S   | Move Down |\n| A   | Move Left |\n| D   | Move Right |\n| Q   | Quit Game |\n\n## Screenshots\n\n```\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                       P                          |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n|                                                  |\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n\nScore: 0\nControls: W=Up, S=Down, A=Left, D=Right, Q=Quit\nCollect blueberries (B) and avoid obstacles (X)!\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open source and available under the MIT License.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
