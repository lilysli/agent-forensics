Clone this repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/test/go-game.git\n   cd go-game\n   ```\n\n2. Run the game:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n3. During gameplay:\n   - Enter coordinates as \""x y\"" (e.g., \""3 4\"" to place a stone at row 3, column 4)\n   - Type \""pass\"" to skip your turn\n   - The game ends when both players pass consecutively\n   - Final scores are counted and the winner is announced\n\n## Game Rules (Simplified)\n\n- Black plays first\n- Players take turns placing stones on empty intersections\n- Once placed, stones cannot be moved\n- The game ends when both players pass consecutively\n- Score is counted by the number of stones on the board (simplified scoring)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.x\n\n## Note\n\nThis is a simplified version of Go that doesn't implement:\n- Capturing stones\n- Ko rule\n- Territory scoring\n- Handicap stones\n\nIt's designed as an educational introduction to the game mechanics.""}",/go-game/README.md,1229
