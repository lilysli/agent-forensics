1. Create a project folder
2. Create the necessary files for a Go game
3. Write the code for a simple Go game
4. Push the project to GitHub

Let me break this down:

1. First, I need to create a folder for the project
2. Create files like main.py, game.py, etc.
3. Write the code for a simple Go game implementation
4. Initialize git, add files, commit, and push to GitHub

I'll need to use the folder_command to create folders, file_command to create and write files, and terminal_command for git operations.

For the GitHub URL, the user mentioned https://github.com/test/repo-name, so I'll need to replace repo-name with something appropriate like ""simple-go-game"".

Let me start by creating the project folder structure.",859,,0

1. Created a folder structure for the Go game project
2. Created a main.py file with a simple Go game implementation

4. Initialized a Git repository
5. Added the files to Git
6. Committed the changes
7. Set up the remote GitHub repository
8. Pushed the code to GitHub at https://github.com/test/go-game

The Go game implementation includes:
- A 9x9 board (simplified size for demonstration)
- Basic move placement with validation
- Player turn switching
- Pass functionality
- Simple scoring based on stone count
- Game over condition when both players pass consecutively

The README provides clear instructions on how to play and run the game.

The project has been successfully pushed to the specified GitHub repository.",917,"Perfect! I've successfully created a simple Go game application and pushed it to GitHub. Here's what I've accomplished:

## Project Structure
- Created `/go-game` directory
- Implemented `main.py` with a basic Go game
- Added `README.md` with instructions and documentation

## Game Features
- 9x9 board (simplified for demonstration)
- Two-player turn-based gameplay (Black and White)
- Move validation to prevent invalid placements
- Pass functionality for skipping turns
- Game ends when both players pass consecutively
- Simple scoring based on stone count
- Clear board display with coordinates

## GitHub Repository
The project has been successfully pushed to: **https://github.com/test/go-game**

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/test/go-game.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd go-game`
3. Run the game: `python main.py`
4. Follow the prompts to place stones using coordinates (e.g., ""3 4"") or type ""pass"" to skip your turn

The game is a simplified version of Go that demonstrates the core mechanics while being accessible for beginners. The implementation focuses on the fundamental rules of stone placement and turn management, making it a great starting point for learning about this ancient board game.",1255
